# dinner_generator

Generates a specified amount of recipes provided in input.txt to serve as a weekly schedule of what to have for dinner. Current functionality only allows for generating a list, and re-generating it. The random function removes the current output from the input pool so that recipes do not repeat two weeks in a row.

TODO list:

- [ ] Extend current CLI to integrate all functionalities
- [ ] add a frontend
- [ ] fetch recipes from somewhere online
